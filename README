Here you can find my thesis and the code used for my thesis about:

Optimizing fairness in machine learning systems 
through random repair of a biased dataset.

============
Tutorial
===========
To run the repair code you must first run the dataprep and disparate code.
Then run the code till line 802 for the adult income datset and 875 for the COMPAS recidivism dataset 
to get all overview and graphs of Random repair with the logistic and random forest classifer.

For more details in classifications made look at what amount of repair(lambda) gives the desired amount of fairness 
(Disparate Impact) and then manualy adjust at line 802(adult) or 875(compas); the coded_data_repair3 and coded_data_repair4 to 
x_repair_LO_0XX and x_repair_RF_0XX where XX equals the desired amount of fairness. Then run the rest of the code.

Abstract 
============

Machine learning systems use datasets that could have biases in their data. 
These biases could cause unwanted biases in decision making towards groups 
with sensitive attribute such as race, gender and sexual orientation [5][7]. 

A possible method to address this problem is a preprocessing method called 
Random Repair which was introduced in [1] in 2018. 

In this thesis we provide insights on the effects that random repair has on 
fairness and classifier accuracy in machine learning systems. We applied 
random repair on the adult income dataset and on the COMPAS recidivism dataset. 
These datasets are known to be biased datasets [5][13]. For each dataset, we 
compared the fairness and accuracy of a logistic regression classifier and a 
random forest classifier after preprocessing the datasets with no repair and 
random repair. In this thesis we measure the fairness called demographic parity
of our classifiers by calculating the disparate impact index. 

Our research shows that increasing the demographic parity in both datasets, 
through random repair causes the desired amount of fairness but also results 
in a classifier accuracy loss in both classifiers.
